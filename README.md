## Simple Compiler by dx



A lightweight web-based compiler developed by dx for compiling and executing source code. This project demonstrates basic compiler functionalities using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with a responsive and user-friendly interface.

## Overview
The Simple Compiler project aims to provide users with a straightforward tool to compile and run source code snippets directly in their web browser. It supports various programming languages and showcases essential compiler components such as input handling, compilation logic, and output display.

This project is ideal for educational purposes, allowing users to understand the basics of how compilers work and interact with the underlying code execution environment. Additionally, it serves as a base for further development and enhancement, such as supporting more programming languages and adding advanced features like syntax highlighting and code suggestions.

## Features
・Interactive Code Compilation: Enter your source code and compile it directly in the browser.
・Responsive Design: Ensures optimal viewing and interaction experience across a wide range of devices.
・Night/Day Mode: Toggle between dark and light themes for improved readability.
・Error Handling: Provides feedback for compilation errors, aiding in debugging code.
・Modern UI/UX: A sleek and intuitive interface that enhances user experience.

## Installation
To deploy the Simple Compiler locally, follow these steps:

1 - **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the following command:

`bash
git clone https://github.com/eerieweb/dx-Compiler.git`

`cd dx-Compiler`

2 - **Open the project:** Navigate to the project directory and open the index.html file in your preferred web browser.
 ・You can do this by double-clicking the index.html file or by opening it through your browser's "Open File" option.

 3 - **Setup a local server (optional)**: For a more seamless experience, you may set up a local server using tools like Live Server in VSCode or a simple HTTP server in Python.

  **If you have Python installed, you can use:**
  
`python -m http.server 8000`

 **Open your browser and go to:**
 
`http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

Once the Simple Compiler is set up and running in your browser, you can use it as follows:

1 - **Enter Source Code:** In the provided textarea on the main page (index.html), input your source code. This could be a simple "Hello, World!" program or any other code snippet you wish to compile.

2 - **Compile Code: Click** on the "Compile" button to process and execute the entered source code.

3 - **View Output:** The results or errors from the compilation are displayed in the designated output area below the "Compile" button. This output will include any print statements from your code as well as error messages if the compilation fails.

4 - **Toggle Night/Day Mode:** Use the toggle switch in the header to switch between dark and light themes. This feature is designed to enhance readability based on your preference or the ambient lighting conditions.

5 - **Explore Additional Features:**

・**Error Feedback:** When your code contains errors, detailed feedback will be provided in the output section to help you identify and fix issues.

・**Responsive Design:** Resize your browser window or access the compiler on different devices to experience the responsive design. The interface adjusts to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience.
